######################################	

In Django, a model is a class which is used to contain essential fields and methods. 
Each model class maps to a single table in the database.

Django Model is a subclass of django.db.models.Model and each field of the model class represents a database field (column).

Django provides us a database-abstraction API which allows us to create, retrieve, update and delete a record 
from the mapped table.

Model is defined in Models.py file. This file can contain multiple models
