For Django forms you dont need models.py

steps same as ModelForms , follow chages in form.py and models.py files

Django provides a Form class which is used to create HTML forms. 
It describes a form and how it works and appears.

It is similar to the ModelForm class that creates a form by using the Model, but it does not require the Model.

Each field of the form class map to the HTML form <input> element and each one is a class itself, 
it manages form data and performs validation while submitting the form.
