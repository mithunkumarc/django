Django is a web application framework written in Python programming language. 

It is based on MVT (Model View Template) design pattern. 

The Django is very demanding due to its rapid development feature.

It takes less time to build application after collecting client requirement.

By using Django, we can build web applications in very less time. 

Django is designed in such a manner that it handles much of configure things automatically, 
so we can focus on application development only.
