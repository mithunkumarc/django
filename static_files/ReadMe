This project is a continuation of template example 
static :

1. creating static folder under app
2. under static folder save images
3. create javascript files under static>js folder
4. create css files under static>css folder




In a web application, apart from business logic and data handling, 
we also need to handle and manage static resources like CSS, JavaScript, images etc.

It is important to manage these resources so that it does not affect our application performance.

Django deals with it very efficiently and provides a convenient manner to use resources.

The django.contrib.staticfiles module helps to manage them.
