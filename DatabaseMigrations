Migration is a way of applying changes that we have made to a model, into the database schema. 

Django creates a migration file inside the migration folder for each model to create the table schema,
and each table is mapped to the model of which migration is created.

Django provides the various commands that are used to perform migration related tasks. 
After creating a model, we can use these commands.

    makemigrations : It is used to create a migration file that contains code for the tabled schema of a model.
    migrate : It creates table according to the schema defined in the migration file.
    sqlmigrate : It is used to show a raw SQL query of the applied migration.
    showmigrations : It lists out all the migrations and their status.
