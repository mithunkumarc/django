Model forms

It is a class which is used to create an HTML form by using the Model. 
It is an efficient way to create a form without writing HTML code.

Django automatically does it for us to reduce the application development time.
For example, suppose we have a model containing various fields, we don't need to repeat the fields in the form file.

For this reason, Django provides a helper class which allows us to create a Form class from a Django model.
